    <h2>Author’s Note</h2>
    <p>
      This is my book, not of pride, but of wounds.  
      I am the one who failed her.  
      I am the one who broke what was whole.  
    </p>
    <p>
      These pages are not excuses,  
      but attempts to face my mistakes —  
      to admit them, to sit with them,  
      and maybe, one day, to rise from them.  
    </p>
    <p>
      If she ever reads this,  
      know that every word is written with trembling hands,  
      with guilt heavy as stone,  
      but also with a fragile hope  
      that I might someday be worthy of her love again.  
    </p>

          <h3>The Beginning of My Apology</h3>
          <p>
            I broke the trust you gave me,  
            like glass in shaking hands.  
            I see the shards in your eyes,  
            and every word cuts deeper than anything.

          <h3>The Scratch on My Skin</h3>
          <p>
            When my words pierced you,  
            you reached for me in fury  
            your nails left a red reminder,  
            a wound that stings,  
            but it hurts less than knowing  
            I caused the deeper wound in you.

          <h3>How We Began</h3>
          <p>
            A message, a smile,  
            the first time our hands touched.  
            You trusted me fully then,  
            and I wore that trust like sunlight.

          <h3>One Night of Pretending</h3>
          <p>
            You whispered,  
            “Can we pretend it didn’t happen, just for this night?”  
            And we loved each other again,  
            bodies tangled,  
            hearts broken,  
            still reaching for warmth  
            inside the chaos I created.

          <h3>The Silence</h3>
          <p>
            You do not want to see me.  
            I am outside the door of your heart,  
            waiting, fearing,  
            praying the silence  
            is not the final answer.

          <h3>Her Anger</h3>
          <p>
            You tell me,  
            “Do what I say. Listen to me now.”  
            I bow, I listen,  
            not because I am weak,  
            but because your pain  
            deserves more space than my pride.

          <h3>Reconnecting with God</h3>
          <p>
            I kneel in despair,  
            asking God why I failed,  
            why I could not understand myself.  
            My prayers are fragments  
            but in them,  
            I hope to rebuild not just her trust,  
            but my own soul.

        <div class="page">
          <h3>Patience</h3>
          <p>
            I will wait.  
            Even if waiting feels like dying,  
            even if the clock turns against me.  
            For her healing,  
            I will hold my ground  
            and let her breathe.
