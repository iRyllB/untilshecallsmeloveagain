      <p>
        I kneel before the altar,<br>
        though night still clings to my bones.<br>
        I lift my hands, shaking,<br>
        and whisper the words I cannot say aloud.
      </p>

        "Come near to God and he will come near to you." - James 4:8
      </p>

      <p>
        Lord, forgive the man I was,<br>
        who strayed into temptation,<br>
        who broke the trust of the one You gave me,<br>
        who let desire blind his eyes<br>
        and pride harden his heart.
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." - 1 John 1:9
      </p>

      <p>
        I pray for mercy,<br>
        though I feel none for myself.<br>
        I pray for strength,<br>
        though my knees are weak from shame.<br>
        I pray for her <br>
        the one I have wounded,<br>
        whose love was a mirror<br>
        I shattered with careless hands.
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgiving each other, just as in Christ God forgave you." - Ephesians 4:32
      </p>

      <p>
        Every day I rise,<br>
        I bow, I fall, I pray again.<br>
        Even if the earth crumbles beneath me,<br>
        even if my body dies before my soul<br>
        has learned humility,<br>
        I will call on You.

        "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit." - Psalm 34:18
      </p>

      <p>
        Let my tears water the soil of repentance,<br>
        let my sorrow shape the clay of my heart,<br>
        let my longing for forgiveness<br>
        become a ladder to Your grace.

        "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me." - Psalm 51:10
      </p>

      <p>
        Guide my words, Lord,<br>
        that they may be soft enough to heal,<br>
        my silence, that it may give her peace,<br>
        my patience, that it may prove my love.

      <p class="verse">
        "A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger." - Proverbs 15:1
      </p>

      <p>
        Even in suffering,<br>
        I will not despair.<br>
        Even in solitude,<br>
        I will not stop seeking You.<br>
        For You are the light that pierces the shadows,<br>
        the river that cleanses the stain of sin,<br>
        the voice that whispers,<br>
        “Rise again, my child.”

        "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you." - 1 Peter 5:7
      </p>

      <p>
        I pray for her trust to return,<br>
        for her heart to find comfort,<br>
        for my own spirit to learn humility,<br>
        and for both of us to walk in Your ways.
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        "Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding." - Proverbs 3:5
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if the night stretches endless,<br>
        even if my own hands must carry the weight of my mistakes,<br>
        I will pray —<br>
        until the heavens hear,<br>
        until my soul is quiet,<br>
        until I can stand once more<br>
        and call her love,<br>
        with a heart that is unbroken and pure.
