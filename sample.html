        I thought desire was harmless fire,  
        a moment that would pass.  
        But fire burns,  
        and now I hold the ashes of your trust  
        in trembling hands.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">The Wounds</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
        There is a scratch on my skin,  
        a mark left in anger —  
        but it pales beside the wound  
        I carved in your heart.  

        My body will heal.  
        But you?  
        I pray I have time to help  
        stitch the soul I tore open.  
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">A Fragile Night</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-pre-line">
        "Can we pretend it didn’t happen,  
        just for tonight?" you whispered.  

        We reached for each other,  
        two broken hearts  
        clutching at what was once whole.  

        But even in your arms,  
        I felt the ghost of my mistake  
        watching us.
