# Until I Can Call Her "Love"...Again

**A digital book of regrets, love, suffering, and hope.**

This is a personal project: a website that acts as a poetic diary, telling the story of mistakes, heartbreak, and the journey toward healing and reconciliation. The goal is to reflect on my actions, express regret, and document the slow process of making amends and reconnecting with love â€” and God.
